# Machine Learning

Here are my solutions to ML problems.

## Exercise 1 - Linear Regression

* Uni/Multivariate linear regression
* Using gradient descent
* Using normal equation

## Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression

* Basic logistic regression
* Logistic regression with regularization
* Minimizations using ```fmincg``` and ```fminunc```

## Exercise 3 - Neural Networks I

* One vs All classification
* Muticlass classification using neural-nets
* Forward propagation in neural-nets

## Exercise 4 - Neural Networks II

* Forward + Backpropagation in neural-nets
* Handwritten digits recognition using neural-nets

## Exercise 5 - Bias vs. Variance - Learning curves

* Learning curves for linear regression
* Validation curves of training costs vs. cross-validation costs + decision making

## Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

* Linear kernel (no kernel) SVMs
* Gaussian kernel SVMs for non-linear classifications (hyperplane classifier)
* Spam e-mails classification using Gaussian kernel SVMs

## Exercise 7 - Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* K-means clustering basics - grouping + randomized initializations
* K-means clustering for colors' reduction + image compression
* PCA basics (Eigen vector reductions - singular value decomposition)
* PCA for dimensionality reduction for facial images

## Exercise 8 - Anomaly detection + Recommender Systems

* Anomaly detection using multivariate gaussians
* Application of anomaly detection to network server failures
* Collaborative filtering (front-back X-Theta learning) basics
* Application of collaborative filtering for real-life movie recommendations
